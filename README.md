# CS-499 CAPSTONE
### <a href="https://github.com/ZacharyHancock/CS499/tree/main/SWE_Artifact"> Artifact 1: Software Design and Engineering </a>
This artifact originates from CS-405: Secure Coding course. The <a href="https://github.com/ZacharyHancock/CS499/tree/main/SWE_Artifact/Original"> original artifact </a> is coded in C++ originally, showcasing different methods of secure coding principles from buffer overflow protection to SQL injection protection. The inclusion of this code as artifact 1 is justified by complying with the following course outcomes: outceome 3 by demonstrating algorithmic design through secure encryption, outcome 4 by converting to Python libraries to demonstrate broad techniques and skills, and outcome 5 by implementing encryption algorithms and handling user data responsibly demonstrates the application of secure software engineering principles. 
While enhancing this artifact I learned some cross domain knowledge by converting the code from C++ to Python, by making me learn how to implement the same functionality with a different set of libraries and higher level language. The main challenge during this process was ensuring the proper and same logic and functionality while coding in a different language. This was challenging like it is challenging in translating from English to Spanish and vice-versa, in turn this became a great learning benefit because it made me understand the intricacies and similiarities/differences in the two languages. I further enhanced the artifact by enhancing the logic alognside the original plan of converting to Python.
