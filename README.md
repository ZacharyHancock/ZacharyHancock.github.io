# CS-499 CAPSTONE
### <a href="https://github.com/ZacharyHancock/CS499/tree/main/SWE_Artifact"> Artifact 1: Software Design and Engineering </a>
This artifact originates from CS-405: Secure Coding course. The <a href="https://github.com/ZacharyHancock/CS499/tree/main/SWE_Artifact/Original"> original artifact </a> is coded in C++ originally, showcasing different methods of secure coding principles from buffer overflow protection to SQL injection protection. The inclusion of this code as artifact 1 is justified by complying with the following course outcomes: outceome 3 by demonstrating algorithmic design through secure encryption, outcome 4 by converting to Python libraries to demonstrate broad techniques and skills, and outcome 5 by implementing encryption algorithms and handling user data responsibly demonstrates the application of secure software engineering principles. 

While enhancing this artifact I learned some cross domain knowledge by converting the code from C++ to Python, by making me learn how to implement the same functionality with a different set of libraries and higher level language. The main challenge during this process was ensuring the proper and same logic and functionality while coding in a different language. This was challenging like it is challenging in translating from English to Spanish and vice-versa, in turn this became a great learning benefit because it made me understand the intricacies and similiarities/differences in the two languages. I further enhanced the artifact by enhancing the logic alognside the original plan of converting to Python. 

### <a href="https://github.com/ZacharyHancock/CS499/tree/main/DS%26A_Artifact/main"> Artifact 2: Algorithmns and Data Structures </a>
This artifact originates from CS-360: Mobile Architecture and Programming course. The <a href="https://github.com/ZacharyHancock/CS499/tree/main/DS%26A_Artifact/main/Original"> original artifact </a> is an Android app called WeightWare that has simple features including: weight entry, weight entries table, ability to add/delete weights, and the ability to enable/disable SMS reminders to input weight entries. I included this artifact in the capstone because I remember not being fully comfortable with the union of UI/UX design and functionality while designing and programming the Android app. This made me want to dive back into it and get into some more uncomfortable territory by implementing more complicated features that will create a more intuitive and impactful end-user experience. I accomplished the enhancement of this artifact by including new features like a line graph to visualize the trend of the users weight inputs and a weight goal, entry for inputting a weight goal, and lastly using slope-intercept form to predict what date the goal weight will be reached. In these enhanced features I demonstrated skills in algortihmns through the use of slope-intercept form to predict a date and  enhanced UI/UX design principles by implementing the line graph to visualize trend analysis, ultimately these featues created a more impactful end-user experience. 

The outcomes that I set out to achieve, and accomplished, in this artifact enhacement are the following: outcome 3 by analyzing user data and generating meaningful predictions and trend analysis and outcome 4 by integrating analytical and predictive methods showing the ability to use modern tools and technologies to deliver a meaningful feature that users value. The main challenge I faced was implementing the line graph, the struggle came from integrating it with the original source code. At some points the graph would not update after a weight entry as well as the line graph being populated in the wrong order, wiht dates reversed. To fix theses I had to update the listener for weights updating to include a refresh of the chart as well as reversing the order of the graph to ensure a proper line graph with current real time information. In conclusion, I feel like I met all the goals for this artifact enhancement, strenghtening my confidence in integrating algorithmns with UI/UX.
